No single char function names allowed
Error reportng
Whenerver something cracks, it halts
Repeated arg names alowed
Some weird parsing errors
string concatenation behaves weird, or at least reports weird things
string multiplication behaves weird, or at least reports weird things



WEIRD:

let len (xs : [int]) : int = 
	match xs with
		[] -> 0
		| h::t -> 1 + len t
in len (1::2::3::4::5::[]) end

WEIRD PARSING:

let max (x:char) (y:char) : char = if x > y then x else y in
	let max3 (xyz : (char * char * char)) : char = 
		let x, y, z = #1(xyz), #2(xyz), #3(xyz) 
		in max #1(xyz) (max #2(xyz) z) end
	in max3 ('a', 'b', 'c') end
end
